Run a simple stress test on a webserver by sending it a bunch of requests.

Usage:
1. Start master by using master.rb
2. Start slaves(slave.rb) and point them to the master.
3. Start the webserver running
4. Use runTest.rb to send the desired test to the master. You can configure which file to request, as well as how many times each slave should request it.

The slaves send a heartbeat message to the master every two minutes. The master uses these message to keep a list of alive slaves with whom to schedule tests. Once the master stops responding(by killing the master process), all of the slaves will terminate. 
The master prunes its list of active slaves every five minutes.



While this software could be used to perform a DDoS, it was written to test webserver projects for CS339 at Williams College, and should not be used on webservers with out permission.
